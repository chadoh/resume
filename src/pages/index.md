Talks

Make it RAEN: Tooling for Ambitious Open Web Apps
--------

The biggest gap in NEAR's current tooling & education exists between "hackathon Proof-of-Concept" and "full-scale app". How's a hacker to evolve a weekend project into a well-architected codebase that serves a userbase of millions? What are the best current patterns for building on the Open Web, and how can a builder upgrade to the latest patterns "for free", harnessing the research and development of the whole ecosystem, rather than re-performing the research themselves?

RAEN has already laid the foundation for tooling that answers these questions. We'll learn how it works now, where it's headed, how to get started (so easy!), and how to get involved.

NEAR vs Soroban vs CosmWasm: how SDKs wrap the key-value store
------

One of the first things you do when writing a smart contract is create some data and store it. Every blockchain I know of uses a key-value store to persist this data, but the way various SDKs provide access to that data store varies significantly. This video compares the approaches of three different Rust-to-WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contract platforms: NEAR, Soroban, and CosmWasm.

Online/Offline Equivalence: What our interplanetary tomorrow can teach us about building apps today
------

An introduction to building web apps that perform well, no matter how slow a user's network speed, and a tour of some of the ways the web may evolve in the future.

Quiz Quizzical Quixotic: Managing Pure-State UI Flows Without Losing It
-------

A talk about the messes we sometimes make when creating nice user experiences, and how to turn them into nice developer experiences as well. The code-cleanup discussed in this video eventually became an open source library, [react-quizzical](https://github.com/chadoh/react-quizzical).
